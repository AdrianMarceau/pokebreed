        <h2>What is the PokéBox Breeding Simulator?</h2>
        <p>Add up to 10 different Pokémon to the zone and then watch as they grow, evolve, multiply, and eventually faint leaving their offspring to continue the cycle.</p>
        <p>The kinds of Pokémon you add to a zone can alter it's appeal to other species and can either positively or negatively affect their growth and breeding behaviors over time.</p>
        <p>Pokémon will typically only breed with their own species, but adding a single Ditto to your zone at the beginning can give every species a head-start on egg production.</p>
        <p>This is a simulator and not an actual game, so you're free to play however you want and come up with your own goals. Just relax and let the Pokémon do their thing.</p>

        <h2>Future Goals for the Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow the user to Pause and Resume the simulator at-will</li>
            <li>Allow the user to start the simulator with less than 10 Pokémon if they want to</li>
            <li>Keep track of which species the player has seen so-far and have it persistant between sessions, display somewhere</li>
            <li>Revise breeding so that gender ratios and egg groups can be respected so that Pokémon like Jynx and Hitmonlee can breed and function</li>
            <li>Program a predator/prey relationship so that the more perasive species (looking at you, Magikarp) can be kept in check by stronger ones</li>
            <li>Optimize the code so that it's faster and the animations / redraw functions are smoother and less resource-intensive</li>
        </ul>
