        <h2>What is the PokéBox Simulator?</h2>
        <p>
            Add up to 10 different Pokémon to the zone and then watch as they grow, evolve, multiply, and
            eventually faint leaving their offspring to continue the cycle. The kinds of Pokémon you add to a
            zone can alter it's appeal to other species and can either positively or negatively affect their
            growth and breeding behaviors over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pokémon will typically only breed with their own species, but adding a single Ditto to your zone at
            the beginning can give every species a head-start on egg production. This is a simulator and not an
            actual game, so you're free to play however you want and come up with your own goals. Just relax
            and let the Pokémon do their thing.
