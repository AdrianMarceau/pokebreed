        <h2>Basic Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
            Add up to 10 different Pokémon to your box and then press play.  Watch as they grow, evolve,
            multiply, and eventually die leaving their offspring to continue the cycle. The kinds of Pokémon
            you add to a box can alter its appeal to other species and can greatly affect its resident's growth
            and breeding behaviours over time.  Whenever you're ready, STOP the simulator then try a different
            combination of starter Pokémon.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic goal of the simulator is to encounter <em>all</em> the different species and forms
            of Pokémon using a single box and only a handful of starter Pokémon as seeds. Your starter Pokémon
            can be used to attract other similar species, and then those can be used to attract even more.
            Check your Pokédex after playing for a bit to see how many species you've registered so far!

            <h3>Type Appeal</h2>
            <p>
                Each species that lives in your box contributes to the global Type Appeal values in some way.
                Fire types, for example, attract other Fire types...  but they also <em>repel</em> Bug, Grass, and Steel types due to their type-advantage over them.
                Likewise, because Fire types are weak to Rock and Ground attacks themselves, Pokemon of those types may be attracted to the box as well.
                All basic Pokémon have the same potential influence over a box's appeal but fully-evolved and special or legendary Pokémon have considerably more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Type Appeal values affect many things, but the most notable are evolutions and breeding.
                Some Pokémon may find a certain type more or less appealing, and may either evolve into or produce offspring with a new typing to compensate.
                If the appeal values are just-right, Pikachu can evolve into Psychic types, Ninetales can give birth to Ice types, and Gloom can decide to shed their Poison type to become pure Grass.

            <h3>Evolution Mechanics</h3>
            <p>
                Simply putting Pokémon into a zone will cause most of them to grow and eventually evolve naturally, but some Pokémon require specific conditions to reach their next stage of development.  Some species rely on high or low type appeal values to evolve, others rely on the presence of other Pokémon, and some even have their own unique evolution methods. Experiment with different combinations of Pokémon to see what happens!
